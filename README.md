# Abstract

Pairwise interactions between species can be modified by other community members, leading to emergent dynamics that are contingent on the composition of a community. Despite the prevalence of such higher-order interactions, little is known about how they are linked to the timing and order of species’ arrival. Yet, these temporal patterns typically affect their pairwise interactions (i.e., priority effects) and thus could also modify higher-order interactions in multispecies communities. Here, we first develop a general framework of time-dependent interaction modifications by building on pairwise priority effects. By applying this framework to data generated by a mechanistic plant-soil feedback model, we show that how pairwise interactions are modified by a third plant depends on the relative sequence and spacing of plants’ germination phenology. This time-dependence of interaction modifications emerges from concurrent changes in plant and microbe populations and they become stronger with a higher overlap between plants’ associated microbiomes. We discuss how processes in the plant-soil feedback model represent a wide range of mechanisms applicable in other systems from which similar time-dependent interaction modifications can emerge. Our results highlight the need to integrate temporal shifts of species interactions to predict the emergent dynamics of natural communities.

# Code Files

All simulations were run in R version 4.2.1.

- `Functions_PSF.R` contains all functions used for contructing the plant-soil feedback model.
- `GenerateData.R` contains code for generating data using the mechanistic plant-soil feedback model.
- `GenerateData_MultipleParams.R` contains code for generating data using randomly selected parameters; this is required for the sensitivity analysis (see Appendix of the manuscript).
- `ModelFitting.R` contains all code for fitting the simulated data to phenomenological models of higher-order interactions.
- `Analysis_Tidy.Rmd` contains code for creating all figures in the main text and Appendix.

# Data

The `Data` directory contains four subdirectories:
- `Standard` is the default directory that contains all results in the main text.
- `Long` contains data from simulations with longer years and fixed interval between plant $i$ and $j$. This set of simulations is only performed with three-plant models.
- `AlternativePerc` contains data from simulations with different percentages of overlap in microbiomes. This set of simulations is only performed with two-plant models.
- `Repetition` contains *fitted interaction coefficients* from simulations with random parameters. This set of simulations is only performed with three-plant models.

The name of raw data (i.e., data simulated from the plant-soil feedback model) has three components:
- `ij` or `ijk`: data generated from two- or three-plant models;
- `al`, `nc`, or `co`: representing different degrees of overlap between microbiomes; `al` represents $v_{ji} = 0.2V_i$, `nc` represents $v_{ji}=0$, and `co` represents $v_{ji}=0.8V_i$ (see also Figure 2);
- `ts` or `rs`: `ts` represents data generated from a time series, `rs` represents data generated by a response surface design for one year (see Methods).

All data are `.csv` files.
